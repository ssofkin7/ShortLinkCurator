Library Page

Areas for Improvement:

Tabs Usage: The tabs show counts (e.g., YouTube: 1, TikTok: 0), but the empty tabs (TikTok, Instagram) feel redundant with only one link. Consider hiding empty tabs or adding placeholder text like "Save a TikTok link to see it here!"
Filter/Sort Placement: The "Filter" and "Sort: Newest" dropdowns are on the far right, which might be missed. Move them closer to the tabs or make them more visually distinct (e.g., button styles instead of dropdowns).
Empty State: If the library is empty, there should be a friendly empty state message (e.g., "No links yet—paste one above to get started!").
Tag Interaction: The tags on the link card are clickable (e.g., "music"), but it’s not clear they filter the library. Add a tooltip or label like "Click to filter by tag."
3. Tags Page
Layout Overview:

Top: Search bar for tags and a "Create Tag" button.
Middle: List of tags ("Sabrina Carpenter," "concert," etc.) with usage bars, "View Content," and "Delete" buttons.
Sidebar: Same as Home.
What Works Well:

The tag list is clean and functional, with usage bars providing a quick visual of tag frequency.
The "Create Tag" button is prominent, encouraging manual tag creation alongside AI tags.
The "View Content" and "Delete" buttons are intuitive for managing tags.
Areas for Improvement:

Tag Correction: There’s no "Edit" button to rename tags (e.g., change "pop" to "pop music"). Add an "Edit" button next to "View Content" and "Delete" to fully support your tag correction feature.
Tag Previews: The page would be more engaging if each tag showed a preview of associated content (e.g., thumbnails of links tagged "music").
Search Bar Usage: The "Search tags…" bar is fine, but it could be more useful if it also suggested tags as the user types (e.g., autocomplete "mu" to "music").
Visual Appeal: The usage bars are a bit plain. Add color (e.g., blue for the bar, gray for the background) to make them pop.
4. Analytics Page
Layout Overview:

Top: Search bar (same as others).

Middle: "Analytics Dashboard" with:

Areas for Improvement:

Charts: The placeholders ("Charts feature coming soon") make the page feel unfinished. Prioritize adding these charts (e.g., a line graph for content activity, a pie chart for platform distribution) using a library like Chart.js. 
Top Categories: The "Top Categories" section is empty. Populate it with the tags already in use (e.g., "music," "pop") to show value immediately.
Usage Statistics: This section is also empty. Add basic stats like "Most Active Day" or "Average Links Saved per Week" to make it more engaging.
Visual Appeal: The analytics page is very text-heavy. Add icons or colors to differentiate sections (e.g., a YouTube icon next to "YouTube: 1").
Pro Feature Tease: Since analytics could be a premium feature, add a subtle "Upgrade to Pro for More Insights" prompt in the empty sections.

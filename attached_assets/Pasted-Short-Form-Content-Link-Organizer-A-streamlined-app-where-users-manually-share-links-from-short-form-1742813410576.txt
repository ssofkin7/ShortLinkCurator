Short-Form Content Link Organizer
A streamlined app where users manually share links from short-form content platforms (TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels), AI intelligently organizes and categorizes them, with Supabase integration for data management and Polar.sh handling monthly subscriptions.

Link Submission Interface:

Clean, minimal input field with paste functionality and share-sheet integration for quick link submission.
Users share a link from TikTok, Shorts, or Reels via the app’s share-sheet option or paste it manually. One-tap “Save” button sends it to the system.
AI Processing Dashboard:

Shows real-time analysis with auto-generated tags and categories.
After submission, AI (e.g., powered by an LLM via Supabase Edge Functions) scans the link’s metadata (title, description, hashtags) and suggests tags like “fitness,” “recipe,” or “tech” and a category like “Workouts” or “Cooking.” Users see this live as it processes.
Content Library:

Grid/list view of saved links with thumbnails, organized by AI-generated categories with search and filter options.
Stored in Supabase’s Postgres database, links display with video thumbnails (pulled via Supabase Storage if available) or platform icons. Search by tag or filter by date/platform.
Tag Correction:

Simple one-tap interface to correct AI miscategorizations to improve future accuracy.
If AI tags a DIY video as “Cooking,” users tap to tweak it to “DIY.” Corrections feed back to refine the AI model, hosted via Supabase Functions.
Personalized Recommendations:

Section highlighting trending or related content based on user’s saving patterns.
AI analyzes saved links (stored in Supabase) and suggests trending Shorts or Reels in similar categories, pulled from public web/X data or Supabase-curated feeds.
Supabase Integration:

Database: Postgres tables store links, user-defined folders, and AI-generated tags/categories. Row Level Security (RLS) ensures users only see their own data.
Storage: Optional thumbnail caching for faster load times, tied to each link.
Edge Functions: Host the AI logic for categorization and recommendations, triggered on link save.
Polar.sh Subscription:

Monthly subscription managed via Polar.sh for premium features.
Free tier: 50 links, basic AI categorization. Paid tier ($5/month via Polar.sh): unlimited links, advanced recommendations, and priority support. Polar.sh handles billing and syncs subscription status to Supabase via webhooks.
